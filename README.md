crystring
=========

One programming language to rule the mall.

This is an (experimental) programming language, where everythig is a string.
This means String is the base class of any other class. Decimals are strings.
Arrays are (will be) strings. Objects are (will be) strings.

Why? This is an esoteric programming language to learn how to build compilers,
and have fun.

How to get started?
-------------------

There are a bunch of examples showcasing multiple features of the language in
the `examples/` folder.

Those are also test cases that get run periodically, so you can check the
expected output in the `spec/integration_spec.rb` test file.

To run a program, simply run `bin/crystring program_name`.
